**TODO:**
- Analyze the morpho deposit flow (again)
- Detail how/where rewards are claimed/accured by the vault
- ERC-4626:
  - Deposit flow
  - Withdraw flow
  - convertToShares
  - convertToAssets
  - maxDeposit
  - previewDeposit
  - maxMint
  - previewMint
  - mint
- Extensions:
  - Set referrer
  - Set fees
  - Claim morpho rewards

**Questions:**
- What are the state variables? total assets?
- Define clearly the share price calculation
- Do we need to account for the morpho fee in the share price calculation?
